Practice and compare different ML algorithms on the IRIS dataset

All credits go to Dr. Jason Brownlee @ Machine Learning Mastery (https://machinelearningmastery.com/). I have just followed the code (https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) in his website to learn about the different algorithms in Machine Learning and used them together to compare the accuracies of the various algorithms.
